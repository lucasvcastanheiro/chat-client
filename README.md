# Chat-client

A simple Chat developed for a college assignment with the aim of creating a solution using at least 2 [Web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API).

## Web APIs used

1 - [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) - Used to create a bidirectional communication between client and server, allowing that when a client sends a message it will be sent to all connected users.

2 - [Notification](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Notifications_API) - Used to notify the user when a message arrives and the user doesn't have the chat tab focused on the browser.

3 - [Storage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage_API) - Used to store a user ID provided by server when the connection between client and server is made, this ID will be used to send messages later.
